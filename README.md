# Audiocraft
Audiocraft is a PyTorch library made by Meta for deep learning research on audio generation. At the moment, it contains the code for MusicGen, a state-of-the-art controllable text-to-music model.

## Audiocraft infinity
Adds generation of songs with a length of over 30 seconds.
Disables (hopefully) the gradio analytics.

## Installation
Audiocraft requires Python 3.9, PyTorch 2.0.0. To install Audiocraft, you can run the following:

```shell
# Best to make sure you have torch installed first, in particular before installing xformers.
# Don't run this if you already have PyTorch installed.
pip install 'torch>=2.0'
# Then proceed to one of the following
pip install -U audiocraft  # stable release
pip install -U git+https://git@github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft#egg=audiocraft  # bleeding edge
pip install -e .  # or if you cloned the repo locally
```

## Usage
```python app.py```
## API

Meta provides a simple API and 4 pre-trained models. The pre trained models are:
- `small`: 300M model, text to music only - [🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-small)
- `medium`: 1.5B model, text to music only - [🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-medium)
- `melody`: 1.5B model, text to music and text+melody to music - [🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-melody)
- `large`: 3.3B model, text to music only - [🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-large)

**Needs a GPU!**
I recommend 12GB of VRAM for the large model.

**Note**: Please make sure to have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed when using newer version of `torchaudio`.
You can install it with:
```
apt get install ffmpeg
```

See after a quick example for using the API.

```python
import torchaudio
from audiocraft.models import MusicGen
from audiocraft.data.audio import audio_write

model = MusicGen.get_pretrained('melody')
model.set_generation_params(duration=8)  # generate 8 seconds.
wav = model.generate_unconditional(4)    # generates 4 unconditional audio samples
descriptions = ['happy rock', 'energetic EDM', 'sad jazz']
wav = model.generate(descriptions)  # generates 3 samples.

melody, sr = torchaudio.load('./assets/bach.mp3')
# generates using the melody from the given audio and the provided descriptions.
wav = model.generate_with_chroma(descriptions, melody[None].expand(3, -1, -1), sr)

for idx, one_wav in enumerate(wav):
    # Will save under {idx}.wav, with loudness normalization at -14 db LUFS.
    audio_write(f'{idx}', one_wav.cpu(), model.sample_rate, strategy="loudness")
```
